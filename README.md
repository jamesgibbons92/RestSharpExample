# RestSharpExample
This is an example using RestSharp

## Using OnTestAutomation.com examples
Using these examples helped me get started. Very easy to follow and clear to understand.

I will start to create my own examples and put these into a CI build.

To get public APIs to practice with I used this list - https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
