# RestSharpExample
This is an example using RestSharp

## Using OnTestAutomation.com examples
Using these examples helped me get started. Very easy to follow and clear to understand.

https://www.ontestautomation.com/restful-api-testing-in-csharp-with-restsharp/

I will start to create my own examples and put these into a CI build.

To get public APIs to practice with I used this list - https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis
Also I will use this site for Star Wars data for testing with https://swapi.co/documentation

### How to identify tests to automate API testing
* To verify whether the return value is based on input condition. Response of the APIs should be verified based on the request.
* To verify whether the system is authenticating the outcome when the API is updating any data structure
* To verify whether the API triggers some other event or request another API
* To verify the behavior of the API when there is no return value
